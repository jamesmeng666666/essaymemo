As a gifted composer, Nie Er created over 30 songs during his life. Many of these works showed ordinary people's suffering. His greatest achievement is composing the music for China's national anthem, which encouraged people to fight for the nation.

I hope you are doing well. I'm writing to express my thanks to you for everything you have done during my stay in Shenzhen. 

It was so kind of you to make me feel at home. When I arrived in Shenzhen, everything was unfamiliar to me. However, you have given me a lot of care and taught me some Chinese. Thanks to your help, I have adapted to the digital life so quickly, from using mobile payment to riding shared bikes. 

What's more, it was fantastic to learn about traditional culture with you. I especially enjoyed watching the lion dance during the Spring Festival. Making dumplings together has become another highlight that helped me understand Chinese traditions better. 

Thank you again for your kindness and support! I do hope that we can stay in touch all the time. Welcome to the UK someday! 

Best wishes,

Everyone in the city felt very scared, but Zhuge Liang stayed calm. He came up with a brilliant idea that he ordered soldiers to open the city gates and let some of them pretend to sweep the streets slowly. Meanwhile, he sat on the city wall, playing the zither with a peaceful smile. Sima Yi thought there was an ambush, so he marched his army away.

As we all know, Shenzhen is a wonderful modern city with rich culture and strong technological atmosphere. However, some traditional handicrafts are slowly disappearing. It is our duty to take action to protect and develop them.

We can use digital cameras and computers to record the whole making process of precious crafts，such as paper-cut, dough figurine and kite making. What’s more, it will be more attractive if we post short videos online to let more people know about traditional arts. By combining technology with tradition, we are able to make old crafts come to life and popular again.

Our traditional crafts should be cherished and passed on from generation to generation. Come and join us!`,

A variety of fantastic activities were organized, such as treasure hunt, English corner, book fair, and so on. Among all of them, the English Drama Show impressed me most.
I joined in the drama with my classmates. We practised our lines repeatedly after class and adjusted our facial expressions and gestures over and over again. We spared no effort to polish our acting skills so that we could act vividly on stage. In the end, we put on a brilliant performance.
Not only has this activity greatly improved my oral English, but it also built up my confidence to speak in public. Meanwhile, I truly realized the importance of teamwork.
Yours
